# Behavioral-Biometrics-Identification-using-Machine-Learning-Methodologies
This project seeks to advance the field of behavioural biometrics by developing and evaluating machine
learning models capable of leveraging behavioural patterns to establish a secure initial advantage over
traditional identification methods, such as passwords and physical tokens. Behavioural biometrics, which
analyse patterns in human behaviour such as typing speed, mouse movements, and smartphone usage, offer a
promising alternative due to their potential to provide continuous authentication and enhance security.
However, their practical application has been limited by the need for more empirical research to validate their
accuracy and reliability. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive experiment to assess the effectiveness of
three distinct machine learning models in the context of behavioural biometrics. To facilitate this investigation,
we utilize motion data collected via phone accelerometers, which is available from the UCI Machine Learning
Repository. This dataset provides a rich source of information on the movement patterns of individuals, which
can be harnessed to distinguish between users based on their unique behavioural signatures. The experiment
involves the development and comparative analysis of three different models to determine their efficacy in
recognizing and differentiating between individual users based on their motion data. By examining these
models' performance, we aim to demonstrate the viability of behavioural biometrics for practical applications
and identify key factors that contribute to their accuracy. Our findings underscore the feasibility of using
behavioural sbiometrics as a reliable form of authentication. The results highlight the potential of these
methods to enhance security measures by offering an additional layer of verification that can be seamlessly
integrated into existing systems.
